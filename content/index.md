        <span style="font-size: 21px;"> Goto Lab, affiliated with HKUST(GZ)’s Brain and Intelligence Research Institute, focuses on the neural mechanisms of learning and memory, particularly synaptic plasticity and activity-dependent circuit dynamics. Integrating multi-disciplinary neuroscience approaches, we elucidate memory encoding/maintenance mechanisms and the pathogenesis of cognitive/neurological disorders caused by impaired memory processes. We welcome researchers to join us in advancing neuroscience research. </span>
